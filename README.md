# Console Five Nights at Freddy's

While this project may be competed in the future, it is currently postponed.

Five Nights at Freddy's designed to run on a Windows console window.

Programmed using C++, using Visual Studio 2019.

Five Nights at Freddy's is the point-and-click indie horror game that took the internet by storm, released on Jul 23rd, 2014. Created and developed by Scott Cawthon.

## About The Console Version

This version is designed to be compact and focus mainly on the gameplay aspects of the game, omitting all significant horror and lore elements. The functionality is designed to mimic that of the original game as much as possible. Certain things were adjusted or removed (such as mouse control) due to the limitations by design and 2D perspective (versus the original sudo-3D perspective).

## Controls

## Planned Features
